vyatta-cron
===========

It was vyatta-cron, a Vyatta CLI for cron (what else?).

It served as an example of how to make a Vyatta Core addon package.

It got included in EdgeOS before the VyOS project has started.

It got integrated into VyOS in the early days of the project. Then it served as an example of how to make a new VyOS package.

It was also the first package to get rewritten in the new style with CLI definitions in XML and scripts in Python.

It served as well, but its time is over. The new functionality lived in https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x, together with the rest of rewritten code.
